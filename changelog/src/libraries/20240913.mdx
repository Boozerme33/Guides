@flatfile/javascript@1.4.2
The release includes the following updates:

The Portal style sheet is now only attached once, instead of every time the Portal is opened. This optimization prevents the unnecessary re-attachment of styles, improving performance.

Developers can now specify submit complete options when calling the `complete` method for a job. Two new optional parameters are introduced: `acknowledge` (boolean) and `message` (string). For example: `await api.jobs.complete(jobId, { outcome: { acknowledge: true, message: 'Success!' }})`. If not provided, the default values are `true` for `acknowledge` and `'complete'` for `message`.

The dependency `@flatfile/embedded-utils` has been updated to version 1.3.1.
