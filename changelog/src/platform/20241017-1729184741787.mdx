Updated the useOnClickOutside hook to use React's event system instead of the DOM event system, allowing click events that occur inside a portaled element to bubble up correctly. Replaced usage of the useOnClickOutside hook with the new useReactOnClickOutside hook in CommentItem and SheetView components. Added a ReactOnClickOutsideWrapper component that wraps the app to provide context for the useReactOnClickOutside hook. Minor updates to test cases to account for the new useReactOnClickOutside hook.

For example, in the CommentItem component, the useReactOnClickOutside hook is now used with the containerRef to hide the reactions dropdown when clicking outside:

```tsx
useReactOnClickOutside(containerRef, onHideReactions)
```

In SheetView, the useReactOnClickOutside hook is used with the sheetTableRef to stop commenting mode when clicking outside the sheet table:

```tsx
useReactOnClickOutside(sheetTableRef, onClickOutside)
```

The ReactOnClickOutsideWrapper component provides the context for the useReactOnClickOutside hook, wrapping the entire app in main.tsx:

```tsx
<ReactOnClickOutsideWrapper>
  <Routing />
  <ReactQueryDevtools initialIsOpen={false} />
</ReactOnClickOutsideWrapper>
```

This change ensures that click events inside portaled elements like tooltips, popovers, and modals are correctly detected as outside clicks, simplifying the outside click detection logic for these components.
