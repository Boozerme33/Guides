The provided diff includes changes related to event handling, file management, and tracing in the platform application. Here are the key updates:

Added a new `emitRaw` and overloaded `emit` methods to the `EventsService` to emit events for models with or without a strictly typed domain name. The `emit` method accepts a grant, model, topic suffix, optional payload, and optional environment ID. The `emitRaw` method follows a similar pattern but accepts the full event topic.

In the `FilesController`, removed the OpenTelemetry tracing logic and updated the `createFile` method to use the new `EventsService.emitRaw` method for emitting file creation events. The `getFile` method now directly returns the file model instead of handling undefined cases.

Updated the `FilesService` with the following changes:
- Added the `@TraceMethod` decorator to trace method execution.
- Removed OpenTelemetry tracing logic from the `createFile` method.
- Simplified the `createFile` method to use the new `EventsService.emitRaw` for emitting file creation events.
- Refactored the `deleteFile` method to use the new `EventsService.emit` method for emitting file deletion events.
- Removed the `getFileMaybe` method.

Added a new `TraceMethod` decorator in the `tracing.ts` file to provide a custom decorator for tracing method execution.

Other minor changes include updating the `.eslintrc.js` file to disable the `no-dupe-class-members` rule and updating test cases in `events.service.spec.ts` and `files.service.spec.ts`.
