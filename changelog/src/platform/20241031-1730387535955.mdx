The release notes include the following changes:

The ActorRole model is now generated by Gecko, with a new ActorRoleModel class added. This class extends the generated ActorRoleModelGenerated class, allowing developers to override the generated model if needed.

The ActorRoleResource class has been removed and replaced with the new ActorRoleModel class throughout the codebase. Methods that previously returned ActorRoleResource instances now return ActorRoleModel instances instead.

In the BFFService, the HttpService has been added as a dependency.

In the OAuthService, the handling of actor roles has been updated to use the new ActorRoleModel class.

The AIGenerateBlueprintLogic has been updated to import the JobOperationEnum, JobConfigTriggerEnum, and JobTypeEnum from the appropriate locations.

The OAuthService test suite has been updated to account for the new ActorRoleModel class.

These changes primarily impact the internal representation and handling of actor roles within the application. Developers consuming this package should update their code to work with the new ActorRoleModel class instead of the previously used ActorRoleResource class. No external interface changes are introduced.
