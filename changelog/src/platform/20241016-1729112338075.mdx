The release notes summarize the following changes:

Added a `config` field to the `ResolutionRow` type, which holds configuration data, specifically `markedForDeletion`, for each record in the resolutions table. Updated queries and code to handle the new `config` field.

Added a TODO comment suggesting optimization of the `getCellConflicts` query to chunk the data.

In the `ClipGetResolutions` class, added logic to count the number of records marked for deletion and include it in the summary response.

Added new query parameters `includeRecords` and `includeSummary` to the `getResolutions` endpoint in the `DataClipsController`. These parameters allow selectively including records or summary information in the response.

Updated the `getResolutions` method in the `DataClipsService` to handle the new `includeRecords` and `includeSummary` parameters and return the appropriate response structure.

Implemented logic in the `mergeResolutions` method of the `DataClipsService` to delete records marked for deletion from the source sheet during the merge process.

Modified the `scaffoldResolutionsTable` function to create a `config` column instead of the previous `meta` column in the resolutions table.
