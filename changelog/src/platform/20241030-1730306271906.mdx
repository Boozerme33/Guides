The release notes include the following updates:

A new entitlement key 'newDesignFeatures' has been added. This entitlement determines if new design features are enabled. Developers using this package can check the value of this entitlement to conditionally enable or disable new design features in their application.

The order of some entitlement keys has been changed, but this should not impact the functionality for developers using this package.

No other changes to existing entitlements or their descriptions have been made in this update.
