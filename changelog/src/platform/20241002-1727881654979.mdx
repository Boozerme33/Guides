The metadata object passed to the createWorkingSpace method has been updated. The sidebarConfig and isWorkbookView properties have been removed from the metadata object. This means that when creating a working space for an auto-build, the sidebar will no longer be hidden, and the view will no longer be set to the workbook view by default.
