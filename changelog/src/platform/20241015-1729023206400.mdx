The release notes include the following updates:

A new capability has been added to update record configurations when modifying records in a sheet. This allows setting the `markedForDeletion` flag on a record during the update operation. An example is provided showing how to update a record's values and set the `markedForDeletion` configuration in a single request. This gives more control over record lifecycle management when updating records.
