For this release:

The app namespace value is now taken from the app.namespace property instead of being derived from the app name. This change impacts how the app namespace is determined and used.

The basic listener template has been updated with the latest versions of the @flatfile/api (1.10.0), @flatfile/listener (1.1.0), and @flatfile/plugin-export-workbook (1.0.1) packages. Developers using this template will get the latest features and bug fixes from these updated dependencies.

The binary file basic-listener-node-modules.tar has been updated, likely containing the updated node modules based on the new package versions specified in package.json.
