The time utility functions are updated with improved testing. The `nowInSeconds` function now accurately calculates the current time in seconds by flooring the result. The `past` and `future` functions are updated to properly handle the calculation of past and future times relative to the current time. The tests are also updated to mock the current time using `Date.now` for consistent and deterministic results. The release notes include an example of the expected usage of the `past` and `future` functions, showing how to calculate times relative to the current time.

Example usage:

```typescript
import { seconds } from '@nestjs/throttler'
import { past, future } from './time.utils'

// Calculate a time 5 seconds ago
const fiveSecondsAgo = past(seconds(5))

// Calculate a time 10 seconds from now
const tenSecondsLater = future(seconds(10))
```
