Added a new API endpoint `/spaces/:spaceId/theme` that retrieves a space's theme (logo and primary color) based on a provided URL. The theme is fetched from the Brandfetch API using the BRANDFETCH_TOKEN environment variable. This allows developers to dynamically fetch branding assets for their spaces.

Added functionality to the BFFService to fetch a space's theme from a provided URL using the Brandfetch API. The URL is first parsed to extract the domain, which is then used to query the Brandfetch API for the brand data. The logo URL and primary color are extracted from the response and returned. If the BRANDFETCH_TOKEN environment variable is not set, an error is thrown.

Example usage:

```
GET /spaces/:spaceId/theme?url=https://example.com
```

This endpoint returns an object containing the logo URL and primary color for the provided domain, for example:

```json
{
  "logo": "https://cdn.brandfetch.io/...",
  "primaryColor": "#ff0000"
}
```
