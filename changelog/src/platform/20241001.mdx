Here are the key updates in this release:

- Refactored the IDP (Identity Provider) enum to appear after the AccountDisabledReason enum in the Prisma schema.
- Added a viewOnly decorator on several model primary keys to exclude them from create/update operations.
- Renamed some database column names in various models to match the property names (e.g. driver_settings to driverSettings).
- Added database mappings for some properties that were previously missing (e.g. actions.inputForm renamed to inputForm).
- Refactored data transfer objects (DTOs) to use more specific types like ApiData, PrismaData instead of generic types.
- Updated generated code to use the new DTO types for create/update operations.
- Fixed some incorrect or missing database mappings in constraint, app, appAutobuild and other definitions.
- Excluded some properties with initial values from database mapping to avoid overriding defaults (e.g. appEnvironmentFilters).
- Added default values for some datetime properties to avoid null values.

These changes primarily aim to improve and align the data modeling across the application. There are no new user-facing features or major API changes in this release.
