The release contains the following updates:

A new enum value 'EMPTY' has been added to the AutobuildType enumeration. This allows creating an app autobuild without specifying files, fields, or a prompt. 

When creating an app autobuild with the 'empty' query parameter set to true, a basic workbook with one sheet and one field will be automatically initialized for the app's space.

The AIGenerateBlueprintLogic has been updated to set the autobuild flag to true when creating a new app from a blueprint.

The AppAutobuildsController has been updated to handle the 'empty' query parameter when creating a new app autobuild. If 'empty' is true, no blueprint generation or sample data generation jobs will be enqueued.

For example, to create an empty app autobuild:

```
POST /apps/{appId}/autobuilds?environmentId={environmentId}&empty=true
```

This will create a new app autobuild of type 'EMPTY' and initialize a basic workbook for the app's space.
