The package.json file has been updated to remove the "@flatfile/react" dependency. The AutoBuild.page.tsx file has been modified to center the Loader component vertically within its container. The EmbeddedSpace.tsx file has been completely rewritten. Instead of using the @flatfile/react components, it now embeds the Flatfile space using an iframe. The space URL is constructed dynamically using the spacesUrl utility function and the user's identity token. The loading and error states have been updated to display appropriate messages and components. Additionally, the iframe now takes up the full width and height of its container.
