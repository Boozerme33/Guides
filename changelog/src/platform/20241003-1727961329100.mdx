The release includes the following updates:

A new action "Clear Column" has been added to remove all contents from a column in a sheet. This action will clear the values in the specified column for all records in the sheet. The Clear Column action is available to all users, regardless of their entitlement status.

For accounts with the Source Editor entitlement and workbooks marked as "Extracted From Source", two additional actions have been introduced: "Add Column" and "Remove Column". The Add Column action allows adding a new column to the sheet, while the Remove Column action removes an existing column from the sheet. These actions provide more control over the schema of source-extracted workbooks.

The logic for handling column actions has been updated with a new class `ClearColumnLogic` to support the Clear Column functionality. This class handles the job execution, streaming updates, and record updates to clear the specified column values.

The `stream.utils` module has a new utility function `emitStreamingUpdate` to emit job progress events during streaming operations like clearing columns.

The release also includes related unit tests for the new `ClearColumnLogic` class and updates to existing tests to cover the new functionality.

Example usage:
To clear a column named "Test 1" from a sheet, create a job with the following configuration:

```
{
  operation: "ClearColumn",
  input: { columnName: "Test 1" },
  subject: {
    type: "collection",
    params: { sheetId: "<sheet_id>", columnKey: "Test 1" }
  }
}
```

This will create a job that clears all values in the "Test 1" column for the specified sheet.
