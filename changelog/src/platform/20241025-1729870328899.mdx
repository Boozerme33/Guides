The release notes for the provided changes are as follows:

Added functionality to update a sheet by its ID or by the workbook ID and sheet slug. The `updateSheetById` method updates a sheet by its ID, while the `updateSheetByWorkbookIdAndSheetSlug` method updates a sheet using the workbook ID and sheet slug. Both methods handle cases where the sheet is deleted and throw a `NotFoundException` exception.

The `updateSheetByWorkbookIdAndSheetSlug` method also handles scenarios where there are multiple sheets with the same slug, ensuring that only the undeleted sheet with the specified slug is updated.

Example usage:

```typescript
// Update a sheet by its ID
const updatedSheet = await workbookRepository.updateSheetById(sheetId, { metadata: { foo: 'bar' } });

// Update a sheet by workbook ID and sheet slug
const updatedSheet = await workbookRepository.updateSheetByWorkbookIdAndSheetSlug(workbookId, 'my-sheet', { metadata: { foo: 'bar' } });
```

Additionally, error handling has been improved by throwing a `NotFoundException` when attempting to update a deleted sheet.
