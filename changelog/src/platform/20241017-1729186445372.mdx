The release notes include the following updates:

The `ReactOnClickOutsideWrapper` component now renders a styled `MainWrapper` element instead of a plain `main` element. The `MainWrapper` is styled with a height of 100% using the `styled-components` library. This change ensures that the wrapper element occupies the full height of its parent container.

Additionally, the `onClick` event handler is now attached to the `MainWrapper` element instead of the `main` element. This change ensures that clicks outside of the children components within the wrapper are properly handled, regardless of the height of the wrapper element.
