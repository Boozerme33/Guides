@flatfile/plugin-graphql-schema@1.4.0
The release notes include the following updates:

The package is now bundled using tsup instead of rollup. The @flatfile/plugin-space-configure dependency has been updated to version 0.7.0. A jest.config.cjs file has been added for configuring Jest tests. The package.json file has been updated with new script commands for building, linting, and testing. The exports field has been added to package.json to support Node.js exports. The main entry point has been changed from dist/index.mjs to dist/index.js. The configureSpaceGraphQL function no longer wraps the configureSpace function with a listener, simplifying the API. The codebase has been updated to use Node.js >= 16 and ES modules.
