@flatfile/plugin-xlsx-extractor@3.3.0
This release updates the @flatfile/plugin-xlsx-extractor package to version 3.3.0. The package now uses tsup as the bundler instead of the previous bundler. The dependencies have been updated, including @flatfile/util-extractor to version 2.2.0. The package has been refactored to use ES modules with both CommonJS and ECMAScript module outputs. The test configuration has been updated to use Jest with improved logging, test timeouts, and global setup. New scripts have been added for building, linting, and testing the package. Developers using this package should ensure compatibility with the new module system and updated dependencies.
