@flatfile/plugin-delimiter-extractor@2.3.1
This release includes a bug fix and a dependency update for the @flatfile/plugin-delimiter-extractor package. The countNonEmptyCells function now handles null values correctly when determining if a row likely contains data. Additionally, the fuzzyMatches calculation in the DataRowAndSubHeaderDetection class has been updated to handle null values when comparing header cells to row cells. The @flatfile/util-extractor dependency has been updated to version 2.2.1.
