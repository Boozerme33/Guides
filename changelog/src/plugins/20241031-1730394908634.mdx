@flatfile/plugin-record-hook@1.9.0
This release updates the Rollup configuration for building the package. The include options for Node.js, browser, TypeScript definitions, and UMD have been removed from the Rollup configuration, and the UMD config now specifies the external dependencies to be excluded from the UMD bundle. This change affects the build process and the resulting package distribution, but does not introduce any functional changes to the package itself.
