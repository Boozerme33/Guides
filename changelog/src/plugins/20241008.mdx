@flatfile/plugin-automap@0.5.2
This release reverts a change that was made previously, where the .some() function was replaced with .every().
This change affects the AutomapService class, specifically the isConfident and isStrongOrAbsolute methods.
The isConfident method now checks if every field mapping in the job execution plan has a metadata certainty of Absolute, instead of checking if at least one field mapping has an Absolute certainty.
Similarly, the isStrongOrAbsolute method checks if every field mapping has a certainty of Strong or Absolute, instead of checking if at least one field mapping meets that condition.
This change tightens the criteria for determining if a job execution plan is considered confident or strong/absolute, as it now requires all field mappings to meet the certainty criteria, rather than just one.
Developers using this package should be aware that the criteria for confident and strong/absolute job execution plans have been made more strict with this change.
