@flatfile/plugin-export-workbook@1.0.0
This release updates the @flatfile/plugin-export-workbook package to version 1.0.0. The dependencies @flatfile/plugin-job-handler and @flatfile/util-common have been updated to their latest versions 0.6.0 and 1.4.0, respectively. A change has been made to the exportRecords function to handle array values in cells by joining them with a comma and space when exporting to a workbook. For example, if a cell value is an array like ['apple', 'banana'], it will be exported as 'apple, banana' in the workbook cell.
