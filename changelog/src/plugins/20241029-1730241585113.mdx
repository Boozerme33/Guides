@flatfile/plugin-autocast@3.0.0
The release includes the following updates:

The package has been updated to use the tsup bundler instead of rollup. This change allows for improved bundling and tree-shaking.

The package has updated its dependencies, including upgrading @flatfile/plugin-record-hook to version 1.8.0 and @flatfile/util-common to version 1.5.0. Developers using this package should ensure their application is compatible with the updated dependencies.

The package now exports types for both Node.js and browser environments, providing better compatibility across different environments. The package also includes configurations for linting, testing, and other development workflows.

Developers using this package should rebuild their applications to take advantage of the updated bundling and dependency changes.
