@flatfile/plugin-record-hook@1.8.0
This release introduces the following updates:

The package bundler has been swapped to tsup. The @flatfile/util-common dependency has been updated to version 1.5.0. A new option `options.debug` of type `boolean` with a default value of `false` has been added, which allows turning on debug logging. Several development dependencies and configuration files have been updated to support the new bundler and other tooling changes. Unit and end-to-end test configurations have been separated, and additional checks have been added to the build process.

For developers using this package, the new `options.debug` parameter allows enabling debug logging, which can aid in troubleshooting issues. The updated dependency may introduce changes that could impact functionality, so reviewing the release notes for @flatfile/util-common version 1.5.0 is recommended. The bundler change should not impact the package's external interface, but may improve performance or introduce other optimizations.

Example usage:

```js
import RecordHook from '@flatfile/plugin-record-hook';

const recordHook = new RecordHook({
  debug: true, // Enable debug logging
  // ... other options
});
```
