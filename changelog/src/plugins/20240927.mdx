@flatfile/plugin-xlsx-extractor@3.2.1
The release notes include an update to the documentation for the xlsx-extractor plugin. A new `skipEmptyLines` parameter has been added that allows users to specify whether empty lines should be skipped or included when parsing the Excel file. By default, empty lines are included. The package version has been updated from 3.2.0 to 3.2.1 to reflect this change.

For example, to skip empty lines when parsing an Excel file, you can set the `skipEmptyLines` option to `true`:

```typescript
const options = {
  skipEmptyLines: true
};
const records = await parseExcelFile(fileBuffer, options);
```

Additionally, the `ExcelExtractorOptions` interface has been updated to include the `skipEmptyLines` property, which is a boolean parameter with a default value of `false`.
