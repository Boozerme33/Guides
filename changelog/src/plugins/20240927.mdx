@flatfile/plugin-delimiter-extractor@2.2.1
The delimiter extractor plugin has been updated with the following changes:

The documentation has been updated. The test file csv.txt has been renamed to test-empty-lines.txt. The handling of empty lines has been improved with new options and tests. A new skipEmptyLines option has been added which accepts true, false, or 'greedy' values. When set to true, it skips lines where all values are empty or whitespace. When set to 'greedy', it skips lines where all values are null, empty, or whitespace. When set to false, it includes all lines. New tests have been added to cover the different skipEmptyLines option values. The parser function has been updated to handle the skipEmptyLines option and filter out empty lines accordingly before mapping the data. The version number has been updated to 2.2.1 to reflect these changes.
