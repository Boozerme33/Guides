@flatfile/plugin-space-configure@0.7.0
The release updates the bundling tool for the package from Rollup to tsup. It adds a Jest configuration file for running tests. The package.json file is updated to use the new bundler and include additional scripts for checks, linting, and running unit and end-to-end tests separately. The dependencies are updated, with @flatfile/plugin-job-handler being a minor update. The main entry point is now index.js instead of index.mjs, and additional exports are defined for browser and Node environments. The end-to-end test file is renamed from space.configure.spec.ts to space.configure.e2e.spec.ts.
