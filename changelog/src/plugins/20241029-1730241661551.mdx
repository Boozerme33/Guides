@flatfile/plugin-convert-yaml-schema@0.4.0
This release updates the @flatfile/plugin-convert-yaml-schema package to version 0.4.0. There is a minor change where the package's bundler has been swapped to tsup. The package dependencies @flatfile/plugin-space-configure and @flatfile/plugin-convert-json-schema have also been updated. The package now exports multiple distribution formats including CommonJS and ES modules for Node.js and web browsers. The release also updates the configuration files for linting, testing, and build scripts to work with the new bundler.
