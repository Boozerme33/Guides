@flatfile/plugin-convert-openapi-schema@0.4.0
The release introduces the following changes:

The package bundler has been swapped from Rollup to tsup. This is a minor change that affects the internal build process. 

The @flatfile/plugin-space-configure dependency has been updated to version 0.7.0. This is a patch update for consumers of the package.

The package now exports types in the .d.ts and .d.cts formats for both Node.js and browser environments. This improves TypeScript support for developers using the package.

The package.json file has been updated to reflect the new bundler and export configurations. The build scripts have also been updated accordingly.

The jest.config.js file has been renamed to jest.config.cjs to align with the Node.js CommonJS module resolution. This is an internal change that should not affect package consumers.

Overall, these changes aim to improve the internal build process, update dependencies, and enhance TypeScript support for the package.
