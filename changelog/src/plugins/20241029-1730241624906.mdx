@flatfile/plugin-json-extractor@0.9.0
This release introduces several changes to the @flatfile/plugin-json-extractor package. The package now uses tsup instead of rollup for bundling. The package's dependencies have been updated, including an update to the @flatfile/util-extractor package to version 2.2.0. A new Jest configuration file has been added for running tests. The package now outputs both node and browser builds, with separate entry points for each environment. The package structure has been updated to align with the new module system, with separate entry points for type definitions and JavaScript code. The package scripts have been updated to use tsup for building and linting, and new scripts have been added for running unit and end-to-end tests separately. The package now includes configuration files for tsup and Jest. Overall, these changes aim to improve the package's bundling, testing, and compatibility with modern module systems.
