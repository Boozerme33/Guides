@flatfile/plugin-convert-json-schema@0.5.0
The release notes for version 0.5.0 of the @flatfile/plugin-convert-json-schema package include the following changes:

The package has switched to using tsup as the bundler instead of the previously used bundler. The jest.config.js file has been renamed to jest.config.cjs. The package.json file has been updated with new build scripts and configuration for tsup, including defining exports for different environments. The @flatfile/plugin-space-configure dependency has been updated to version 0.7.0, which is a minor update. Developers using this package should ensure they have updated their dependencies accordingly and review any changes introduced by the updated @flatfile/plugin-space-configure dependency.
